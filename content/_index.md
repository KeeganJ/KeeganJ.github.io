# Hello,

My name is Keegan Jorgensen, and I'm a software engineer. 

I work at [Caretaker](https://caretaker.com) as the Head of Engineering. I build automation to make the lives of landlords and tenants easier.

Most of my projects are in fullstack web development. I specialize in backend technologies that keep websites running fast at scale. My current work uses Typescript, React, NodeJS, and Postgres.

Here you'll find a collection of posts, details about me, and links to various projects I've worked on. Content will optimize for desktop, mobile, print, and dark mode for easy reading in any medium.

This blog is open source and [available on Github](https://github.com/keeganj/keeganj.com). Feel free to suggest changes to correct typos or improve this site's usability.
